## GRAVI-T (2010)

GRAVI-T is a mobile game developed as part of a group project at the University of Applied Sciences Bremen. As the player, you must navigate the game character through a continuous obstacle world by tapping on the screen to reverse the gravity. I was responsible for animating the game character and displaying the highscore. GRAVI-T was programmed using Objective-C and the Cocos2D game engine.
