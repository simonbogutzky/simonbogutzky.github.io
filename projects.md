## Easter Egg Hunt Bremen 2011 

I was involved in the development of the Easter Egg Hunt Bremen 2011 app, which was an innovative treasure hunt event. Virtual Easter eggs were scattered across ten areas in Bremen and could be seen on the app within a range of five meters. By tapping on an Easter egg and then shaking their iPhone, players could redeem one of three coupons. The app was programmed in Objective-C and used technologies such as UIKit, MapKit, CoreLocation, and CoreData. My specific contributions to the project included the map interaction, user account management, and the REST-like communication with the backend. The backend was implemented using the CakePHP framework.

## GRAVI-T (2010)

GRAVI-T is a mobile game developed as part of a group project at the University of Applied Sciences Bremen. As the player, you must navigate the game character through a continuous obstacle world by tapping on the screen to reverse the gravity. I was responsible for animating the game character and displaying the highscore. GRAVI-T was programmed using Objective-C and the Cocos2D game engine.
