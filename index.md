# About me

![Me](/images/portrait.jpeg){:style="border-radius: 50%; width: 200px; height: 200px;"}

I was raised in Germany, where I currently reside just 50 kilometers from Bremen. I received my education in Media Informatics and Digital Media at the University of Bremen, where I later earned my PhD in Engineering. My career has been centered on mobile application development, and I am particularly skilled in programming for iOS using Swift. Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about programming and strive to continually improve my skills in this field.
