						IlcoControl (2016) 
					</h2>
					<p>
						As the sole developer of IlcoControl, a control app for care beds, I am responsible for the creation and implementation of the app's features and functionality. Communication between the app and the care bed is facilitated through Bluetooth technology, and the corporate design of the app is customizable for each client. The trade show prototype of IlcoControl was programmed in Swift and utilizes UIKit and CoreBluetooth. This project marks my first time developing an app entirely in Swift.

						FlowMeter (2016) 
					</h2>
					<p>
						The FlowMeter app, developed by me as the sole developer, allows users to track and record their subjective experience of "flow" according to Mihály Csíkszentmihályi's theory. Simultaneously recording heart rate data via a Bluetooth HR chest strap, the FlowMeter app presents this information in easy-to-read diagrams. Users also have the option to upload their data to Dropbox or transfer it to their computer via iTunes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Written in Objective-C and utilizing UIKit, CoreData, and CoreBluetooth, FlowMeter employs third-party libraries to efficiently compress, upload, and display data. Unfortunately, the FlowMeter app is no longer available in the Apple App Store.

						Flow Machine (2015) 
					</h2>
					<p>
						I was involved in the development of the Flow Machine app, which is designed to help users turn physical activity into a habit in their daily life. I contributed to the architecture of the app and developed the framework for step and event detection, as well as storage. The app is programmed in Objective-C and uses technologies such as UIKit, MapKit, CoreData, CoreLocation, and CoreMotion to provide a visually appealing interface, track the user's location and movements accurately, and store and analyze data efficiently. By detecting the beginning, steps, turns, and end of a walk, the Flow Machine creates a soundscape that plays as the user walks, encouraging them to stay active and form a healthy habit.

						RiderApp (2014) 
					</h2>
					<p>
						As a founder of out there! communication UG, I was involved in the development of the RiderApp, a social network for trail riders. In 2014, the RiderApp was commissioned by Noma GmbH from out there! communication UG, which was a shareholder at the time. I programmed parts of the app in Objective-C, and my specific contribution to the project included the map interaction feature, which used MapKit, CoreLocation, and MapBox to allow users to interact with maps within the app. Unfortunately, the RiderApp was discontinued in 2022. Through the RiderApp, trail riders were able to connect with each other, share information about trails and rides, and potentially plan group rides or events.

						cubodo (2012) 
					</h2>
					<p>
						cubodo is a game that involves transporting virtual packages over real-world distances. In the game, players can create their own packages or pick up packages from other players and transport them to different locations. To earn points and progress in the game, players must drop off the packages and add content to them by taking a picture. The app uses MapKit, CoreLocation, and other technologies to track the movement of the packages and allow players to interact with them on a map. My specific contributions to the project included the map interaction, user account management, and the REST-like communication with the backend, which was implemented using the CakePHP framework. Cubodo was developed as a master project at the University of Applied Sciences Bremen, and the success of the project led to the formation of the startup out there! communication UG.

						Easter Egg Hunt Bremen 2011 
					</h2>
					<p>
						I was involved in the development of the Easter Egg Hunt Bremen 2011 app, which was an innovative treasure hunt event. Virtual Easter eggs were scattered across ten areas in Bremen and could be seen on the app within a range of five meters. By tapping on an Easter egg and then shaking their iPhone, players could redeem one of three coupons. The app was programmed in Objective-C and used technologies such as UIKit, MapKit, CoreLocation, and CoreData. My specific contributions to the project included the map interaction, user account management, and the REST-like communication with the backend. The backend was implemented using the CakePHP framework.
