						1 Responsible
					</h2>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Dr. Simon Bogutzky<br>
						Hermannstr. 5<br>
						27313 DÃ¶rverden<br>
						Telefon: +49 (0) 4234 9435236<br>
						E-Mail: me@simonbogutzky.com
					</p>
					<h2 class="mt-4">
						2 Basic information
					</h2>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In this privacy policy, I inform you about the nature, scope and purpose of the collection and processing of your personal data. As the person responsible, I take data protection seriously and treat personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal provisions.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						I recommend that you read through the privacy policy again at regular intervals, as changes may be made to the privacy policy as a result of the constant further development of third parties or by me.
					</p>
					<p>
						Definitions of the terms used (e.g. "processing" or "personal data") can be found in Art. 4 DSGVO.
					</p>
					<h2 class="mt-4">
						3 Access data
					</h2>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						3.1 Description, scope and purpose of data processing
					</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						When my websites are accessed, the cloud provider or the cloud computing infrastructure automatically collects and stores data. This data includes the website visited, the date, time, size of the data sent, the browser used and the IP address used for access. When using the data, I do not draw any conclusions about you as a subject. The data is stored exclusively for security reasons, for example, to localize errors in the cloud computing infrastructure or to clarify cases of abuse.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The temporary storage of the IP address is necessary to enable delivery of the web pages to your end device. For this purpose, your IP address must remain stored for the duration of your session.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						As provider I use GitHub and its infrastructure (https://docs.github.com/de/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
					</p>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						3.2 Legal basis for data processing
					</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The legal basis for the temporary storage of data is Art. 6 ABS. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
					</p>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						3.3 Duration of storage
					</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						GitHub automatically deletes the data as soon as the necessity for achieving the purpose of their collection expires. For the provision of my websites, this is the case when the respective session has ended.
					</p>
					<h2 class="mt-4">
						4 Contact details
					</h2>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						4.1 Description, scope and purpose of data processing
					</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						If you contact me using the contact options offered, I will store your information so that I can use it to process and respond to your request.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Without your consent, I will not pass on your personal data to third parties.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						If you contact me via the contact form, the form solution provider or cloud computing infrastructure automatically stores the date, time, size of the data sent, the browser used and the IP address used. As form solution provider, I use Fromspree and its infrastructure (https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy/).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Alternatively, it is possible to contact me via the provided e-mail address. The communication via e-mail takes place from my side via Telekom E-Mail.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						This updates the privacy policy to reflect the use of GitHub as the cloud provider and updates the links to GitHub's privacy policy. You should also review the rest of the privacy policy to make sure that it accurately reflects the data collection and processing practices of your website.
					</p>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						4.2 Legal basis for data processing
					</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The legal basis for processing the data that you provide to me in the course of sending an e-mail is Art. 6 ABS. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
					</p>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						4.3 Duration of storage
					</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						I will delete your data as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. For the personal data that you have sent me via the contact form or by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with you has ended. The conversation is ended when it is clear from the circumstances that the matter in question has been conclusively clarified.
					</p>
					<h2 class="mt-4">
						5 Cookies
					</h2>
					<p class="mb-4">
						My website does not use cookies.
					</p>
					<h2 class="mt-4">
						6 Your rights
					</h2>
					<p class="mb-4">
						You, as a user of my websites, have the right, in accordance with the DSGVO, to free information about which personal data I have stored about you. You also have the right to the correction of incorrect data and to a processing restriction or deletion of your personal data.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Unless your request conflicts with a legal obligation to retain data (e.g. data retention), you have the right to have your personal data deleted. I delete data stored by me when it is no longer necessary for its intended purpose and there are no legal retention periods. If deletion is not possible because the data is required for permissible legal purposes, data processing will be restricted. In this case, I will block the data and to prevent processing for other purposes.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						If applicable, you can assert your right to data portability.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						You can revoke your data protection consent at any time. If you wish a correction, blocking, deletion or information about the personal data stored about you or have questions regarding the collection, processing or use of your personal data or want to revoke the granted declarations of consent, please contact the following e-mail address: me@simonbogutzky.com.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						The legality of the data processing remains unaffected by the revocation until the time of revocation.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						If you assume that I have processed your data unlawfully, you can file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. The supervisory authority to which you have submitted the complaint will inform you about the status and outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Art. 78 DSGVO.
